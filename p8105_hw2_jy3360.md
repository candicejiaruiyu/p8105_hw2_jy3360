# Problem 1

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv.

- Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables
  year, month, and day;
- replace month number with month name;
- create a president variable taking values gop and dem,
- and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
pols_month <- read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, `01` = "Jan", `02` = "Feb", `03` = "Mar", 
                        `04` = "Apr", `05` = "May", `06` = "June", 
                        `07` = "July", `08` = "Aug", `09` = "Sep", 
                        `10` = "Oct", `11` = "Nov", `12` = "Dec")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    c(prez_gop, prez_dem),
    names_to = "politicians",
    names_prefix = "prez_",
    values_to = "president"
  ) %>%
  select(-"day")
```

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, - arrange according to year and
month, - and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp <- read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), day = as.integer(day), month = as.integer(month)) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  relocate(year, month) %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, `01` = "Jan", `02` = "Feb", `03` = "Mar", 
                        `04` = "Apr", `05` = "May", `06` = "June", 
                        `07` = "July", `08` = "Aug", `09` = "Sep", 
                        `10` = "Oct", `11` = "Nov", `12` = "Dec")) %>%
  select(-"day")
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets.

- This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long” format;
- ensuring that key variables have the same name;
- and ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment <- read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, 
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "unemployment"
               ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
data_1 <- left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month")) %>%
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

Note: we could have used a date variable as a key instead of creating
year and month keys; doing so would help with some kinds of plotting,
and be a more accurate representation of the data. Date formats are
tricky, though. For more information check out the lubridate package in
the tidyverse.

<span style="color: blue;"><b>Answer 1:</b></span>

- There are 1644 rows and 12 columns in the dataset.
- The years range from 1947 to 2015.
- The key variables contain year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop,
  gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, politicians, president, close,
  unemployment.

# Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  read_excel
- use reasonable variable names
- omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
- The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes
  powered. This calculation is described in the Homes powered note, but
  not applied to every row in the dataset. Update the data to include a
  new homes_powered variable based on this calculation.

``` r
library(readxl)
mr_trash_wheel <- readxl::read_excel("202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                                  range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>%
  mutate(trash_wheel = "mr")
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda,

- and combine these with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single
  tidy dataset.
- To keep track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an
  additional variable to all datasets before combining.

``` r
professor_trash_wheel <- readxl::read_excel("202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                  sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", 
                                  range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>%
  mutate(trash_wheel = "professor")

gwynnda_trash_wheel <- readxl::read_excel("202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                  sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", 
                                  range = "A2:K109") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>%
  mutate(trash_wheel = "gwynnda")

trash_wheel_total <- bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, professor_trash_wheel, gwynnda_trash_wheel) %>%
  relocate(trash_wheel)
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.

- Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset,
  and give examples of key variables.
- For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
  Professor Trash Wheel?
- What was the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
  July of 2021?

<span style="color: blue;"><b>Answer 2:</b></span>

- `mr_trash_wheel` contains 547 rows and 15 columns of data.
- `professor_trash_wheel` contains 94 rows and 14 columns of data.
- `gwynnda_trash_wheel` contains 106 rows and 12 columns of data.
- The final data set `trash_wheel_total` contains 747 rows and 16
  columns of data. The variables are trash_wheel, dumpster, month, year,
  date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls,
  homes_powered, plastic_bags.
- The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is
  190.12.
- The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of
  2021 is 16300.

# Problem 3

Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics.

- Ensure that sex and APOE4 carrier status are appropriate encoded
  (i.e. not numeric),
- and remove any participants who do not meet the stated inclusion
  criteria (i.e. no MCI at baseline).

``` r
baseline_original <- read_csv("data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, `0` = "female", `1` = "male")) %>%
  mutate(apoe4 = recode(apoe4, `0` = "non-carrier", `1` = "carrier")) 
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
baseline <- read_csv("data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, `0` = "female", `1` = "male")) %>%
  mutate(apoe4 = recode(apoe4, `0` = "non-carrier", `1` = "carrier")) %>%
  filter(age_at_onset!= ".")
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset.
- How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
  MCI?
- What is the average baseline age?
- What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?

<span style="color: blue;"><b>Answer 2:</b></span>

- During the import process, it’s important to skip the first line of
  the data since it is the dictionary of the variable names.
- `baseline` contains 97 rows and 6 columns of data.
- The variables are id, current_age, sex, education, apoe4,
  age_at_onset.
- 483 participants were recruited. of these 483 participants, 97 develop
  MCI.
- The average baseline age is 65.0467909.
- The proportion of women in the study who are APOE4 carriers is
  0.1304348

Similarly, import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally
observed biomarker values; comment on the steps on the import process
and the features of the dataset.

Check whether some participants appear in only the baseline or amyloid
datasets, and comment on your findings.

- Combine the demographic and biomarker datasets so that only
  participants who appear in both datasets are retained,
- and briefly describe the resulting dataset;
- export the result as a CSV to your data directory.
